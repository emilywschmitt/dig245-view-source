<h2>How to Use Dev Tools</h1>
  <p>
    If you've ever used the internet (I know you have because you're reading this right now),<br>
    you've probably come across some cool websites or pages and wondered "how did they make that???"<br>
    Well, with Dev Tools, you can find out. Diving into the source code behind your favorite websites can<br>
    teach you a ton about coding and design and it's easy to do! Just follow these simple steps.
  </p>
<ol class="lists">
  <li>This can be done on any website, but for these instructions we'll practice with <a href="https://tesssmithroberts.co.uk/">Tess Smith Robert's art site</a> </li>
  <li>Dev Tools will only fuction on Chrome, so be sure to either download the Chrome browser and open your website in the Chrome app.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the webpage and right-click anywhere to open up your menu.<br>
    Be sure to click somewhere that won't take you anywhere else on the page, like a button or shopping cart.</li>
  <li>Once you're in the menu, click on 'inspect.'</li>
  <li>A window will pop up on the right-hand side of your screen. You are now inside that website's source code!

<h2>A New Metaphor</h2>
<p>There's nothing quite like a great metaphor...</p>
<b>Using Dev Tools is lifting the veil of a bride on her wedding day.</b>
<ul>
  <li>You know what they look like, I mean you're marrying them today. Yet, lifitng the veil reveals more<br>
    beauty than you ever could have imagined.</li>
    <li>You understand them more now than ever before. You're ready to say, I do. Because, looking into their<br>
       eyes, after you've lifted their veil - the truth is revealed and love ensues.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Hidden Message</h2>
<p>If you use the Dev Tool steps above, you can find a bunch of hidden surprises in many webstie's source codes.<br>
   For example, inside <a href="https://www.qwantz.com/about.php">Dinosaur Comics'</a> source code you can find this hidden dinosaur image:
</p>
 <img src="assets/img/dino-code.jpg" width=600px height=500px>
 <p>This is how I feel about learning HTML and CSS a lot of the time.</p>
