<h2>How to Use Dev Tools</h1>
  <p>
    If you've ever used the internet (I know you have because you're reading this right now),<br>
    you've probably come across some cool websites or pages and wondered "how did they make that???"<br>
    Well, with Dev Tools, you can find out. Diving into the source code behind your favorite websites can<br>
    teach you a ton about coding and design and it's easy to do! Just follow these simple steps.
  </p>
<ol class="lists">
  <li>This can be done on any website, but you must use Chrome as your browser.</li>
  <li>Navigate to any webpage and right-click anywhere to open up your menu.<br>
    Be sure to click somewhere that won't take you anywhere else on the page, like a button or shopping cart.</li>
  <li>Once you're in the menu, click on 'inspect.'</li>
  <li>A window will pop up on the right-hand side of your screen. You are now inside that website's source code!
    <br>If you want to learn about some more things you can dow with Dev tools, check out our list below!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Other Cool Things to Do With Dev Tools</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>CSS Selectors.</b> Get the CSS selector from an element if you're having trouble specifying in CSS.</li>
  <li><b>Edit as HTML.</b> This is a good way to test changes in code by seeing what visually changes when you edit the HTML.</li>
  <li><b>Scroll into view.</b> This is an easy way to naviagte the website within Dev Tools by bringing different elements into the viewport.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A New Metaphor</h2>
<p>There's nothing quite like a great metaphor...</p>
<b>Using Dev Tools is turning over a picture to find the name, location, and date handwritten on the back of the photo.</b>
<ul>
  <li>Say you're flipping thorugh an old family scrapbook. The pictures bring back good memories and the group pictures remind you just how large<br>
    your extended family is. Yet, there are a couple of faces that are less than familiar. And where are you all? And when are you all?</li>
    <li>You slide the photo out of its sleeve and find, written on the back in your grandmother's lovely cursive writing, the date, location, and <br>
    name of every person in the photo.</li>
    <li>While revelaing the source code behind a website may not bring back such nostaligic memories, what it does do is answer questions<br>
      just as the writing on the back of a photo does: when it was made, who made it, who helped make it, and how it came to be.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Hidden Message</h2>
<p>If you use the Dev Tool steps above, you can find a bunch of hidden surprises in many website's source codes.<br>
   For example, inside <a href="https://www.qwantz.com/about.php">Dinosaur Comics'</a> source code you can find this hidden dinosaur image:
</p>
 <img src="assets/img/dino-code.jpg" width=600px height=500px>
 <p>This dinosaur represents how I feel about learning HTML and CSS a lot of the time.</p>
